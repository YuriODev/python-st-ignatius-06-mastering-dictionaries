**Problem:** Print the elements of a dictionary where keys are numbers from `1` to `n` (both inclusive) and values are the squares of the keys. `n` is an integer input provided by the user.

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 5      | {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25} |
| 2   | 3      | {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9} |
| 3   | 7      | {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49} |
| 4   | 1      | {1: 1} |
