## Exercise 1: Day of the Week Dictionary - Easy üòä (Est. Time: 5-10 mins | Points: 10)

**Problem:** Create a dictionary where the keys are the names of the days of the week, and the values are integers representing the ordinal number of the day of the week from 0 to 6.

### Output:
- The name of the day corresponding to the ordinal number, or no output if the number is out of bounds.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs   |
| --- | ------ | --------- |
| 1   | 3      | Wednesday |
| 2   | 0      | Sunday    |
| 3   | 5      | Friday    |
| 4   | 7      |           |
