### Specifications:
- **Input:**
  - `n` (int): The upper limit of the range, provided by the user.

- **Output:**
  - A dictionary where:
    - Keys are integers from 1 to `n`.
    - Values are the squares of the keys.

## Exercise 3: Weekday Dictionary Lookup

**Objective:** Create a program that constructs a dictionary where keys are the names of the days of the week, and values are integers representing the day's ordinal number from 0 to 6. Print the name of the day for a given ordinal number input. If the input ordinal number is out of bounds, the program should not print or report any errors.

### Specifications:
- **Data Structure:**
  - A dictionary with:
    - Keys as the names of the days of the week (str).
    - Values as the ordinal numbers of the days from 0 to 6 (int).

- **Input:**
  - An integer representing the ordinal number of the day.

- **Output:**
  - The name of the day corresponding to the input ordinal number.

### Example Usage:

| No. | Inputs | Expected Outputs |
|-----|--------|------------------|
| 1   | 3      | Wednesday        |
| 2   | 0      | Sunday           |

This exercise involves handling user input to retrieve information from a predefined dictionary without error messages for invalid inputs.

## Exercise 4: Character Count Dictionary from String

**Objective:** Write a program that creates a dictionary from an input string to count the occurrence of each character.

### Specifications:
- **Input:**
  - A string from which to count characters.

- **Output:**
  - A dictionary where:
    - Keys are characters from the input string.
    - Values are the counts of each character's occurrences in the string.

### Example Usage:

| No. | Inputs                        | Expected Outputs                                                                                                                                 |
|-----|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet    | {'L': 1, 'o': 3, 'r': 2, 'e': 2, 'm': 3, ' ': 4, 'i': 2, 'p': 1, 's': 2, 'u': 1, 'd': 1, 'l': 1, 't': 2, 'a': 1}                                  |
| 2   | hello world                  | {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, ' ': 1, 'w': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1}                                                                                  |
| 3   | character                    | {'c': 2, 'h': 2, 'a': 2, 'r': 2, 'e': 1, 't': 1}                                                                                                   |

This exercise focuses on iterating over the characters in a string, counting their occurrences, and storing these counts in a dictionary for output.

## Exercise 5: Character Frequency in a String

**Objective:** Write a program to count the frequency of characters in a given string.

### Specifications:
- **Input:**
  - A string of characters provided by the user.

- **Output:**
  - The frequency of each character in the string, printed as separate lines for each character.

### Example Usage:

| No. | Inputs    | Expected Outputs |
|-----|-----------|------------------|
| 1   | google    | g 2              |
|     |           | o 2              |
|     |           | l 1              |
|     |           | e 1              |
| 2   | test      | t 2              |
|     |           | e 1              |
|     |           | s 1              |
| 3   | character | c 2              |
|     |           | h 2              |
|     |           | a 2              |
|     |           | r 2              |
