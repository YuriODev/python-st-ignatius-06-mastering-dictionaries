## Exercise 1: Day of the Week Dictionary - Easy 😊 (Est. Time: 5-10 mins | Points: 10)

**Problem:** Create a dictionary where the keys are the names of the days of the week, and the values are integers representing the ordinal number of the day of the week from 0 to 6. Print the name of the day for the entered ordinal number. If the entered number is out of bounds, the program does not print any message or indicate an error.

### Input:
- An integer representing the ordinal number of the day.

### Output:
- The name of the day corresponding to the ordinal number, or no output if the number is out of bounds.

### Examples:

| No. | Inputs | Outputs   |
| --- | ------ | --------- |
| 1   | 3      | Wednesday |
| 2   | 0      | Sunday    |
| 3   | 5      | Friday    |
| 4   | 7      |           |

### Note:
This exercise tests the ability to use dictionaries for key-value mappings in Python.
